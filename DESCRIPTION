Description: Provides utilities for identifying drug-target interactions for sets of small molecule or gene/protein identifiers. The required drug-target interaction information is obained from a local SQLite instance of the ChEMBL database. ChEMBL has been chosen for this purpose, because it provides one of the most comprehensive and best annotatated knowledge resources for drug-target information available in the public domain.
